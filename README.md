# PMDD Tracker 🤖

A Discord bot for tracking PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder) symptoms. Users can submit daily symptom reports through an interactive form, and the data is stored in a CSV file for analysis.

## Features

- 📅 **Automated Daily Forms**: Posts a symptom tracking form every day at 6:00 PM America/Chicago timezone
- 📊 **14 Symptom Questions**: Comprehensive PMDD symptom assessment with severity ratings (1-6 scale)
- 💾 **CSV Data Storage**: All responses are saved with user ID, username, date, and answers
- 🔄 **Duplicate Prevention**: One submission per user per day (newer submissions replace older ones)
- ⚙️ **Slash Commands**: Easy data management with `/reset`, `/download`, and `/pester` commands

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- A Discord Bot Token (see setup instructions below)
- Access to a Discord server where you can add the bot

    "DbPath": "pmdd.db"
  }
}
```

**How to get these values:**

1. **DISCORD_TOKEN**: 
   - Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Select your application (or create one)
   - Go to "Bot" section
   - Click "Reset Token" and copy the new token

### 4. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Register Slash Commands

Before starting the bot, register the slash commands with Discord:

```bash
npm run deploy-commands
```

You should see output confirming the commands were registered:
```
✅ Successfully registered 3 application (/) commands:
  - /reset: Clears all symptom data from the CSV file
  - /download: Downloads the complete symptom data CSV file
  - /pester: Manually triggers the daily symptom form to be posted right now
```

### 6. Start the Bot

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
✅ PMDD Tracker is ready! Logged in as YourBot#1234
📅 Scheduled daily form posting at 6:00 PM America/Chicago
```

## Usage

### Daily Symptom Form

The bot automatically posts a symptom tracking form every day at 6:00 PM Central Time. The form includes:

- 14 questions about PMDD symptoms
- Each question has a dropdown with severity levels (1-6):
  - **1** - Not at all
  - **2** - Minimal
  - **3** - Mild
  - **4** - Moderate
  - **5** - Severe
  - **6** - Extreme
- A submit button to save responses

Users must answer all 14 questions before submitting.

### Slash Commands

**`/pester`**
- Manually triggers the daily form to be posted immediately
- Useful for testing or if the scheduled post was missed

**`/download`**
- Downloads the complete CSV file with all symptom data
- Shows the total number of records

**`/reset`**
- Clears all data from the CSV file
- **Warning**: This action cannot be undone! Download data first if needed.

## Data Format

The CSV file (`pmdd_data.csv`) has the following structure:

| User ID | Username | Date | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | ... | Q14 |
|---------|----------|------|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 12345... | user#1234 | 2026-03-13 | 3 | 4 | 2 | ... | 3 |

- **User ID**: Discord user ID (unique identifier)
- **Username**: Discord username with discriminator
- **Date**: Submission date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Q1-Q14**: Severity ratings (1-6) for each question

## Development

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond to slash commands
- Make sure you ran `npm run deploy-commands` after setup
- Verify the bot has proper permissions in your Discord server
- Check that `GuildId` in `appsettings.json` matches your server

### Scheduled form doesn't post at 6:00 PM
- Verify the server timezone where the bot is running
- Check console logs for any errors
- The bot must be running continuously for scheduled posts

### CSV file issues
- Ensure the bot has write permissions in its directory
- Check console logs for file system errors
- If corrupted, you can delete `pmdd_data.csv` and it will be recreated

### Form submission errors
- Users must answer all 14 questions before submitting
- If responses are lost, they're stored in memory and cleared on bot restart
- Check that the CSV file isn't locked by another program

## Bot Permissions

The bot requires these Discord permissions:
- `Send Messages` - To post daily forms
- `Use Slash Commands` - For command interactions
- `Attach Files` - For /download command
- `Read Message History` - To access interaction context
